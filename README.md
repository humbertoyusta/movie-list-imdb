## Functionalities

- The movie list is displayed, with thumbnails, and if you hover it you see the title.
- It is possible to sort by rating, filter by year, and search by title.
- Each movie is linked to its own page, where you can find the details and the full picture
- It is possible to add a movie to the favorites list, and remove it from there.
- There is a favorites page where all the favorites movies are displayed.
- To add a movie to the favorites list, I used NextJS APID, so the favorites are saved even if you refresh the page.
